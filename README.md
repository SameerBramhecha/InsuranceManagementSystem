# Insure It - Insurance Management System
Insure It is a web application created to keep track of customer information and insurance policy details. This platform-based system gives users quick access to data about consumer and insurance resources. The established system's main goal is to ensure that users may access any insurance policies added by the company that are now available, as well as their status, premium, and policy details for all of their prior policies. It also gives administrative users the ability to add or change any insurance policy themselves. Build as a freelance project with a team of four students.
